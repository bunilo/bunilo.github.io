A memory game with autogenerated images which results in a unique experience every single time. <br />
This game was fully developed in C#.;
This was my first project at NHL Stenden, University of applied sciences. <br/>
The language used to develop the software is C#. Besides that we were in the middle of the covid-19 pandemic so we used Microsoft teams to communicate and shared and kept track of our code via GitHub. <br/>
The images used for the cards are all autogenerated resulting in a unique game every single time you play. There is 3 difficulties making the cahnges between cards more difficult. You get bonus points if you get multiple consecutive correct matches in a row.<br />
Although the auto generation was developed by a teammate of mine, we worked very close together as I was the one that worked on the implementation of those cards and the functionality of the game.

The "Plantenwaterinator" is an IOT program that measures the values that a plant needs, for example the moisture of the terrain and the temerature of the environment.
<br /> The IOT systems gets values from sensors connected to an arduino, which the arduino will then send the data gathered to an android app that visualises the data.
<br /> Not only that but it automatically waters te plant when needed and gives you a warning when one of the values is iincorrect.;
The plantenwaterinator is an IOT project where we have a physical object with sensors on and an Android app to visualise the data. <br />
I have mostly worked with the arduino which has the following sensors: <br />
<ul>
  <li>Photoresistor (Light sensor)</li>
  <li>DHT11 (Air humidity and temperature sensor)</li>
  <li>FC-28 (Soil moisture sensor)</li>
  <li>hw-038 (Water level sensor)</li>
</ul>
<br /> <p>The data that the arduino collects from these sensors are send to the Android app. The android app the visualises it and gives a notification when something is off. <br />
If the soil moisture is lower than the value set in the app, the arduino will automatically pump some water into the plant. If the water level of the pump is low a notification will be send to your phone.</p>

Eigenmaaltijd is a website made in C# and ASP.NET by request from a client. <br />
The client would give us their idea and we would implement these requests and discuss them.;
Eigenmaaltijd is a website made in full C# and ASP.NET.<br />
The goal of this website is that people can post that they have leftovers that they want to sell or share those, or are preparing to cook a big meal that you can reserve a portion for.
<br /> The dishes are written in great detail even mentioning if it's vegan, frozen or fresh, ingredients used, when it was created and the expiration date.
<br /> We did this project in collaboration with a client which we had to communicate with and keep up to date. <br />
I worked mostly on the UX/UI part, so I would make the pages in Adobe XD, go over them with the client, adjust them accordingly, design the flow of the pages and actually making the fronted of the pages with empty values that others could work with.

This webpage was purely made for aesthetic purposes and does not really have any functions. <br />
Here there are spiraling 3D cubes used to create a pattern. This pattern, or part of it, is mirrored multiple times to create the kaleidoscope effect.;
This kaleidoscope website was made with three.js. <br />
Three.js was used to make 3d cubes and we mirrored a tiny portion of those cubes multiple times to create the kaleidoscope effect. The colours are automatically generated;
This website was just made for a visual purpose. The kaleidoscope is made out of 3d cubes with three.js. <br />
The colours are randomly generated. If you cange the values in the code to simply add a few more cubes you get more details and the same would go for speed or how many times it would be reflected.

A raytracer made in Java. <br />
A lot of math and linear algebra was used for this project. It was definitely a challenge but must be one of my favorites out there.;
This raytracer was fully developed in Java. Making classes for every shape used and implementing these into the renderer. <br />
Although there is only one ball it has been made in such a way that yuoo can easily edit and add more shapes, such as the plane and triangle class but those have unfortunately not been fully implemented due to lack of time. <br />
I really enjoyed this project since I like to work with lighting and also enjoy math. I am hoping to finish or add other things to this project in the future when I have time.

A barely working simulation with many issues was given to us to "fix". This game is written in C++. <br />
The goal of this project is especially to improve the algorithms and divide processes over the different cores your CPU has. By doing this the simulation will run smoother and will be playable. <br />
<br />
This is currently a work in progress.;
A simulation made in C++. <br/>
This is a project I am currently working on and will be finishing up soon. <br />
The goal of this project is to optimize a simulation that has been given to us by the school. <br />
The provided simulation is very inefficient and runs very slowly. By analyzing the code and editing the algorithms for more efficient ones you can already get quite far. <br />
Besides the algorithms, I will analyze the code and choose areas I can improve as the game isn't functioning properly either. <br />
Last but not least by dividing processes over CPU cores and editing the order they get executed in processes will run smoother and don't have to wait as long for each other.
<br />
I will update this post when the project is finished.

A website made in php where multiple design patterns and security patterns were implemented.;
This website was made in php.
The reason why this is pizzacase 1 and there's a 2nd one is because although this project wasn't approved it was quite the accomplishment. The reason why it wasn't approved was because we made everything in php. <br />
The goal of this website was to make a system that you can order pizza's with. The pizza's needed to have some customization to them such as extra ingredients etc. <br />
Further you had to use Design patterns and Security patterns for the backend. The patterns we chose were: <br />
<ul>
    <li>Singleton</li>
    <li>Composite</li>
    <li>Builder</li>
    <li>Visitor</li>
    <li>Template method</li>
</ul> <br />

This was a huge Big Data project where I have to mention that I gained a ton of experience.<br />
This project was made in Python and a bit of html and scss. <br />
We used a large amount of provided IMDB data. IMDB is a database for movies, shows, cartoons and actors. This data was very much unreadable as it didn't come in collumns, so we cleaned up the data and put it in a database where we can the access it. <br />
This data was used in SQL Queries and R-graphs, which were displayed and used in the website. The website was made in Django to combine the backend python code with html.;
This was a Big Data project where we were provided with very big data files from the IMDB website. IMDB is a database related to movies, series , cartoons and actors. <br />
The provided data was very much unreadable and not properly divided in columns. With the help of <b>regex</b>, scripts we wrote in <b>Python</b> and a lot of effort, as the file was very much a mess, we were able to import the data inside a database. <br />
We all worked on this together and I worked together with someone else on the database design. Once everything was properly imported I began writing <b>SQL</b> queries that would display the data properly in the made <b>DJango</b> website.<br />
For the website we had to make 5 questions and answer them with data and numbers, a <b>R</b> graph for predictions and we've added some graphs for visualization. <br />
The last thing we had to do was answer our hypothesis with proof.<br />
<br />
We also made a video explaining how everything worked which you can find below:

This Robotics project was truly the most fun thing I've done yet.<br />
The project required 3 Majors to work together to create a company and make a product aka the robot within around 2 time.
The following majors worked together on this project: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Software Engineering (ICT). <br />
We setup a company called Earthly Robotics and started our work. We even got a sponsor, as the goal of robot was planting seeds in not only fields but also community gardens and your own back garden, which provided us with seeds and earth. <br />
Besides our company goal the robot had a few tests it had to perform.;
Earthly robotics made a robot in around 2 months to help farmers, governments and households plant seeds for them. <br />
Besides this it had to go through tests and obstacle courses to get approved by the school.<br />
To achieve this the robot had the following components: <br />
<ul>
    <li>Track-tires attached to gears and motors to drive through dirt</li>
    <li>A hopper to dispense seeds</li>
    <li>An app to automatically plant the seeds with the settings the user put in and select different modes</li>
    <li>A controller for manual movement of the robot but also the arm and magnet</li>
    <li>An arm with an electromagnet to pick things up</li>
    <li>Servos in the track-tires to change the position</li>
    <li>PCB for the controller and the robot itself</li>
    <li>Webcam for object recognition</li>
    <li>Arduino for sending signals to the motors and servos</li>
    <li>Raspberry pi for gathering data and sending it to the app and Arduino</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following 3 majors worked together on this project: Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Software Engineering (ICT). <br />
I'll go into depth on what ICT did as I am able to explain this better. ICT worked on the following things: <br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>making a website and keeping it up to date</li>
    <li>making the backend of the robot calculations</li>
    <li>making the functionality of the components</li>
    <li>making an app for the users</li>
</ul><br />
<p>
Now have I worked on the functionality of the components and the research paper. <br />
For the functionality I mean I worked on the arduino and partly the communication between it and the raspberry pi. The arduino had to drive the servos on incoming signals. <br />
The magnet was an electromagnet so when twisted the magnet would get a current and become insanely strong. This had to happen on a button press from the controller.<br />
The tire-tracks had to turn around to be able to get over obstacles. <br />
The hopper had to dispense seeds so we made it spin with a hole inside. <br />
And the most difficult part the arm movement. Originally we had a 2 joint arm which you could control with the controller. For this I used inverse kinematics. Unfortunately they didn't add this function in the controller due to lack of time but the code still exists.<br />
Besides this I made the base code for the motors with the calculations for the gears that Mechanical Engineering gave me.

Unfortunately I am not allowed to tell much about this project, but I did want to include it as I learned Python and gained work experience during this time. <br />
KPN is one of the biggest internet providers of the Netherlands, and I was tasked to make a system where staff can edit their client's subscriptions and packages. <br />
This was made in Django Python.;
I had a half a year full-time internship at one of the biggest internet providers of the Netherlands, KPN.<br />
I worked in their office but unfortunately only for a month as covid hit the world. During the rest of my internship I worked remote. <br />
During my time there I made an app in <b>Django Python</b> where staff and employees can easily see and manage client's packages and subscriptions.
Unfortunately as I was working with personal data I am not allowed to show anything of the app as I had to make everything on a company laptop.
This internship was also my test of competence for my graduation.<br />
<br />
* My experience at the company can be found in my experiences portfolio.

Brainconsultant was my first full time, half a year internship. Brainconsultant is secondment company where I managed their website and I temporarily took over the role of a visual designer too.<br />
Unfortunately it looks like the website has recently gotten a big makeover, so you can't find the results anymore.<br />
Most things I made were improvement of quality of life for clients as well as employees.<br />
I made it easily accessible for clients to contact the company and to navigate through the pages. <br />
For the company I made for example a system where it would automatically generate a curriculum vitae based on what was put in the fields.<br />
During this internship I especially improved on my communication skills as I was the only Application developer at the time. Because of this I learned how to communicate with clients, where here it was my boss, and keep them up to date. Besides that I sometimes had to pick up the phone if no one was in the office.

2020-11-20;
The 5G Student battle was a Hackaton that I participated in. There were multiple big sponsor companies and themes.<br />
We worked together with the Municipality of Groningen with the theme Smart City. We named our team "Team glow" and our original plan was automatic lighting but it was later changed to parking sensors.;
The 5G Student battle was a Hackaton sponsored by big companies. Normally it would be a 24 hour hackaton but unfortunately covid hit.<br />
Our sponsor was the Municipality of Groningen and we got the theme smart city.<br />
At first we wanted to make automatic street lanterns for highways to save on power and reduce light pollution, hence the name team glow.<br />
Unfortunately covid hit and the 5G battle got delayed by 6 months. Unfortunately we still weren't allowed to see each other and of course not at all to stay in a room together for 24 hours. During the 6 month many group members left and we ended up with just 4.<br />
Because of this we made a switch in our plan as it was simply not possible anymore.<br />
We created a parking sensor similar to ones you find in underground garages. But these were designed for outside parking spaces and are connected to an app so you can see exactly where there's space left to park. Not only that but data would be gathered for the municipality so they can see where a lot of people park and act accordingly.<br />
Our ending team was a master university student in Electrical engineering specializing, a bachelor university student who made the API and me and my friend college Application developer students who made the app.
Here's a recap video on how the finals went:<br />
