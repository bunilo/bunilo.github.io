Programming:
<br/>
I am a 3rd year student HBO ICT. During my studies I've gained not only a lot of experience but have finished many projects. <br/>
In this section I will showcase my bigger projects. Feel free to ask for more information if needed.

Art:
<br/>
Art and drawing is mostly a hobby of mine that I want to include into my future career if possible.<br/>
I have never had any art lessons and am fully self-taught. I still wanted to showcase some pieces I have made and will be making in the future, not only for others but also for myself to look back on.

Travel:
<br/>
This section I have added because I have been on quite a few excursions and even on a half a year exchange program. <br/>
Here is a summary of my experiences of the countries, studies and the knowledge I gained from being abroad.
